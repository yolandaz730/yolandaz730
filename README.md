### Hi everyone! My name is Yolanda Zhang and I am currently a junior in Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University. Some of my hobbies include painting, cooking, and playing games such as the Sims 4 or Minecraft. I have also started going to the gym more frequently and started doing some weight lifting. An interesting fact about me is that I was born in Canada but moved to the US when I was 4, so I have dual citizenship. I am new to Github but I have high hopes towards learning and gaining a better understanding towards it.
