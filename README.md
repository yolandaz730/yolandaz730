### Hi everyone! My name is Yolanda Zhang and I am currently a junior in Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University 🚀.
### I am a cat lover😽, a coffee enthuisiast ☕, and my favorite color is pink💗! Some of my hobbies include painting 🎨, cooking 🍳, and playing games such as the Sims 4 or Minecraft 🎮. I have also started going to the gym more frequently and started doing some weight lifting 🏋️‍♀️. An interesting fact about me is that I was born in Canada but moved to the US when I was 4, so I have dual citizenship🍁🦅. 
### I am new to Github but I have high hopes towards learning and gaining a better understanding towards it 👾🤖😸.
